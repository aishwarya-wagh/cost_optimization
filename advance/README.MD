## Executive Summary

This guide provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing Snowflake ETL operations in fintech environments, focusing on cost reduction while maintaining performance and compliance. Key areas include warehouse right-sizing, storage optimization, query efficiency, and automated resource management.

**Cost Reduction Targets:**
- 30-50% reduction in compute costs through warehouse optimization
- 20-30% reduction in storage costs through lifecycle management
- 40-60% improvement in query performance through optimization techniques

## Snowflake Cost Architecture

### Primary Cost Drivers

**Compute Costs (70-80% of total spend)**
- Virtual warehouse usage (billed per second, minimum 60 seconds)
- Auto-suspend and auto-resume settings
- Warehouse sizing and clustering
- Serverless compute for tasks

**Storage Costs (15-25% of total spend)**
- Data storage (compressed, includes metadata)
- Time Travel retention (1-90 days)
- Fail-safe storage (7 days, non-configurable)
- Cloning and data sharing

**Data Transfer Costs (5-10% of total spend)**
- Cross-region data movement
- External data egress
- Replication and disaster recovery

### Cost Monitoring Framework

```sql
-- Daily cost monitoring query
SELECT 
    DATE(start_time) as usage_date,
    warehouse_name,
    SUM(credits_used) as total_credits,
    SUM(credits_used) * 3.00 as estimated_cost_usd, -- Adjust rate
    COUNT(*) as query_count,
    AVG(execution_time_ms) as avg_execution_time
FROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history 
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY usage_date, warehouse_name
ORDER BY usage_date DESC, total_credits DESC;
```

## ETL Design Patterns

### 1. Micro-Batch Processing Pattern

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Incremental processing with CDC
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK financial_transactions_incremental
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_XS_WH'
    SCHEDULE = '5 minute'
    WHEN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM raw_transactions_stream 
        WHERE METADATA$ACTION IN ('INSERT', 'UPDATE')
    )
AS
MERGE INTO curated.transactions t
USING (
    SELECT * FROM raw_transactions_stream
    WHERE METADATA$ACTION IN ('INSERT', 'UPDATE')
) s
ON t.transaction_id = s.transaction_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET
    t.amount = s.amount,
    t.status = s.status,
    t.updated_at = s.updated_at
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (s.*);
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces processing windows from hours to minutes
- Lower warehouse runtime costs
- Improved data freshness for real-time analytics

### 2. Layered Data Architecture

**Bronze Layer (Raw Data)**
- Minimal transformation
- Use VARIANT for semi-structured data
- Implement schema evolution handling

**Silver Layer (Cleansed Data)**
- Data quality validation
- Standardization and enrichment
- Use clustering keys for frequently filtered columns

**Gold Layer (Business Ready)**
- Aggregated and denormalized tables
- Pre-computed metrics for dashboards
- Materialized views for complex calculations

### 3. Zero-Copy Cloning Strategy

```sql
-- Development environment refresh
CREATE DATABASE dev_analytics CLONE prod_analytics;

-- Point-in-time analysis without storage costs
CREATE TABLE audit_snapshot CLONE transactions
    AT (TIMESTAMP => '2024-01-01 00:00:00');
```

## Warehouse Management Strategy

### Right-Sizing Framework

**Warehouse Sizing Guidelines:**

| Workload Type | Size | Use Case | Cost/Hour |
|---------------|------|----------|-----------|
| ETL Micro-batch | XS-S | <1GB data processing | $1-2 |
| ETL Standard | M-L | 1-10GB data processing | $4-16 |
| ETL Heavy | XL-2XL | >10GB, complex joins | $32-64 |
| Analytics | S-M | Interactive queries | $2-8 |
| ML/AI | L-3XL | Model training, inference | $16-128 |

### Auto-Scaling Configuration

```sql
-- ETL warehouse with optimal auto-scaling
CREATE WAREHOUSE etl_processing_wh WITH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 60  -- Suspend after 1 minute
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
    MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1
    MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 3
    SCALING_POLICY = 'ECONOMY';  -- Favor cost over performance

-- Analytics warehouse for user queries
CREATE WAREHOUSE analytics_wh WITH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 300  -- 5 minutes for user experience
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
    MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1
    MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 2
    SCALING_POLICY = 'STANDARD';
```

### Resource Monitoring

```sql
-- Warehouse utilization analysis
WITH warehouse_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        warehouse_name,
        DATE(start_time) as usage_date,
        SUM(credits_used) as credits,
        SUM(DATEDIFF(second, start_time, end_time)) as total_runtime_seconds,
        COUNT(*) as query_count,
        AVG(queued_overload_time) as avg_queue_time
    FROM snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history 
    WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
    GROUP BY warehouse_name, usage_date
)
SELECT 
    warehouse_name,
    AVG(credits) as avg_daily_credits,
    AVG(total_runtime_seconds)/3600 as avg_daily_hours,
    AVG(query_count) as avg_daily_queries,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG(avg_queue_time) > 60000 THEN 'UNDERSIZED'
        WHEN AVG(credits)/AVG(query_count) > 0.1 THEN 'OVERSIZED'
        ELSE 'OPTIMIZED'
    END as sizing_recommendation
FROM warehouse_metrics
GROUP BY warehouse_name;
```

## Storage Optimization

### Data Lifecycle Management

**Time Travel Optimization:**
```sql
-- Reduce time travel for ETL staging tables
ALTER TABLE staging.raw_transactions 
SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 1;

-- Standard retention for business critical tables
ALTER TABLE core.customer_accounts 
SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 7;

-- Extended retention for compliance tables
ALTER TABLE audit.transaction_log 
SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 90;
```

**Automated Data Archival:**
```sql
-- Archive old partition data
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK archive_old_transactions
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_XS_WH'
    SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 2 1 * * UTC'  -- Monthly at 2 AM
AS
BEGIN
    -- Move data older than 2 years to archive table
    INSERT INTO archive.transactions_historical
    SELECT * FROM transactions 
    WHERE transaction_date < DATEADD(year, -2, CURRENT_DATE());
    
    -- Delete archived data from main table
    DELETE FROM transactions 
    WHERE transaction_date < DATEADD(year, -2, CURRENT_DATE());
END;
```

### Clustering Strategy

```sql
-- Clustering for time-series financial data
ALTER TABLE transactions 
CLUSTER BY (transaction_date, account_id);

-- Multi-dimensional clustering for analytics
ALTER TABLE customer_metrics 
CLUSTER BY (DATE_TRUNC('month', metric_date), customer_segment);
```

### Table Design Optimization

```sql
-- Efficient schema design for cost optimization
CREATE TABLE optimized_transactions (
    transaction_id STRING NOT NULL,
    account_id STRING NOT NULL,
    transaction_date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount NUMBER(15,2) NOT NULL,
    currency_code STRING(3) NOT NULL,
    transaction_type STRING(20) NOT NULL,
    metadata VARIANT,  -- Use for flexible schema
    created_at TIMESTAMP_LTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
    
    -- Partition on most common filter
    PRIMARY KEY (transaction_id)
) 
PARTITION BY (DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date))
CLUSTER BY (transaction_date, account_id);
```

## Query Optimization

### Query Performance Patterns

**Efficient JOIN Operations:**
```sql
-- Avoid Cartesian products and large table scans
SELECT 
    t.transaction_id,
    t.amount,
    a.account_name,
    c.customer_tier
FROM transactions t
JOIN accounts a ON t.account_id = a.account_id
JOIN customers c ON a.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE t.transaction_date >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_DATE())
    AND t.amount > 1000
    AND c.customer_tier IN ('GOLD', 'PLATINUM');
```

**Materialized View Strategy:**
```sql
-- Pre-compute expensive aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_account_summary AS
SELECT 
    account_id,
    transaction_date,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount,
    AVG(amount) as avg_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN amount > 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as credit_total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN amount < 0 THEN ABS(amount) ELSE 0 END) as debit_total
FROM transactions
WHERE transaction_date >= DATEADD(year, -1, CURRENT_DATE())
GROUP BY account_id, transaction_date;
```

### Query Monitoring and Optimization

```sql
-- Identify expensive queries for optimization
SELECT 
    query_text,
    warehouse_name,
    execution_time_ms,
    credits_used,
    rows_produced,
    bytes_scanned,
    compilation_time_ms,
    queued_overload_time
FROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history 
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
    AND execution_time_ms > 60000  -- Queries over 1 minute
    AND credits_used > 1
ORDER BY credits_used DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Data Pipeline Architecture

### Serverless Architecture with Tasks

```sql
-- Root task for daily ETL orchestration
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK root_daily_etl
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_S_WH'
    SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 1 * * * UTC'  -- Daily at 1 AM UTC
AS
    CALL sp_validate_source_data();

-- Child task for transaction processing
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK process_transactions
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_M_WH'
    AFTER root_daily_etl
AS
BEGIN
    CALL sp_process_daily_transactions();
    CALL sp_update_account_balances();
END;

-- Parallel task for analytics refresh
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK refresh_analytics
    WAREHOUSE = 'ETL_S_WH'
    AFTER root_daily_etl
AS
    CALL sp_refresh_customer_analytics();
```

### Error Handling and Retry Logic

```sql
-- Robust error handling in stored procedures
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE sp_process_daily_transactions()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
EXECUTE AS CALLER
AS
$$
DECLARE
    error_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
    max_retries INTEGER DEFAULT 3;
    retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
BEGIN
    WHILE retry_count < max_retries DO
        BEGIN
            -- Main processing logic
            INSERT INTO processed_transactions
            SELECT * FROM staging_transactions
            WHERE process_date = CURRENT_DATE();
            
            RETURN 'SUCCESS: Processed ' || ROW_COUNT() || ' transactions';
        EXCEPTION
            WHEN OTHER THEN
                retry_count := retry_count + 1;
                IF retry_count >= max_retries THEN
                    INSERT INTO error_log VALUES 
                        (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), 'sp_process_daily_transactions', SQLERRM);
                    RETURN 'ERROR: ' || SQLERRM;
                END IF;
                CALL SYSTEM$WAIT(retry_count * 30); -- Exponential backoff
        END;
    END WHILE;
END;
$$;
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Cost Alert Framework

```sql
-- Daily cost monitoring procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE sp_monitor_daily_costs()
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
DECLARE
    daily_spend FLOAT;
    threshold FLOAT DEFAULT 1000.00;  -- $1000 daily threshold
BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(credits_used * 3.00) INTO daily_spend
    FROM snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history
    WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
    
    IF daily_spend > threshold THEN
        -- Send alert via external notification system
        CALL system$send_email(
            'dba-team@company.com',
            'Snowflake Cost Alert',
            'Daily spend exceeded threshold: $' || daily_spend
        );
    END IF;
    
    RETURN 'Daily spend: $' || daily_spend;
END;
$$;
```

### Performance Dashboards

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- Credits consumed per warehouse per day
- Query execution time trends
- Storage growth rates
- Failed task counts
- Data freshness metrics
- Concurrent user counts

### Automated Optimization

```sql
-- Auto-scaling based on query queue times
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK monitor_warehouse_performance
    WAREHOUSE = 'ADMIN_XS_WH'
    SCHEDULE = '10 minute'
AS
BEGIN
    -- Scale up if average queue time > 30 seconds
    FOR warehouse_rec IN (
        SELECT warehouse_name, AVG(queued_overload_time) as avg_queue_time
        FROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history
        WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(minute, -10, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
        GROUP BY warehouse_name
        HAVING avg_queue_time > 30000
    ) DO
        EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER WAREHOUSE ' || warehouse_rec.warehouse_name || 
            ' SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = LARGER';
    END FOR;
END;
```

## Fintech-Specific Considerations

### Regulatory Compliance

**Data Retention Requirements:**
- PCI DSS: Minimum 1 year for transaction data
- SOX: 7 years for financial records
- GDPR: Right to be forgotten implementation

```sql
-- GDPR compliant data deletion
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE sp_gdpr_data_deletion(customer_id STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
BEGIN
    -- Log deletion request
    INSERT INTO gdpr_deletion_log VALUES 
        (customer_id, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), 'INITIATED');
    
    -- Remove PII from transactions (keep aggregated data)
    UPDATE transactions 
    SET customer_name = 'DELETED',
        customer_email = 'DELETED',
        phone_number = 'DELETED'
    WHERE customer_id = customer_id;
    
    -- Archive detailed records
    INSERT INTO archived_customer_data
    SELECT * FROM customer_details WHERE customer_id = customer_id;
    
    DELETE FROM customer_details WHERE customer_id = customer_id;
    
    RETURN 'GDPR deletion completed for customer: ' || customer_id;
END;
$$;
```

### Security Best Practices

**Role-Based Access Control:**
```sql
-- Create role hierarchy for fintech environment
CREATE ROLE data_engineer;
CREATE ROLE data_analyst;
CREATE ROLE compliance_officer;
CREATE ROLE risk_manager;

-- Grant appropriate permissions
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE raw_data TO ROLE data_engineer;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA raw_data.transactions TO ROLE data_analyst;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA compliance.audit_logs TO ROLE compliance_officer;

-- Implement row-level security for sensitive data
CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY customer_data_policy AS (account_type VARCHAR) RETURNS BOOLEAN ->
    CASE 
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('COMPLIANCE_OFFICER', 'RISK_MANAGER') THEN TRUE
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'DATA_ANALYST' AND account_type != 'VIP' THEN TRUE
        ELSE FALSE
    END;
```

### Real-Time Risk Monitoring

```sql
-- Streaming fraud detection pipeline
CREATE STREAM transaction_stream ON transactions;

CREATE OR REPLACE TASK fraud_detection
    WAREHOUSE = 'RISK_M_WH'
    SCHEDULE = '1 minute'
    WHEN SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('transaction_stream')
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO fraud_alerts
    SELECT 
        transaction_id,
        account_id,
        amount,
        'VELOCITY_CHECK' as alert_type,
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() as alert_time
    FROM transaction_stream
    WHERE amount > 10000
        OR account_id IN (
            SELECT account_id 
            FROM transaction_stream 
            GROUP BY account_id 
            HAVING COUNT(*) > 10  -- More than 10 transactions per minute
        );
END;
```
